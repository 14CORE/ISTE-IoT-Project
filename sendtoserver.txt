I was wondering if there was a was a way to take something from a text box in the HTML, feed it into flask, then parse that data with Python. I was thinking this might involve some JS but I could be wrong. Any ideas?

python flask

ANS:
Unless you want to do something more complicated, feeding data from a HTML form into Flask is pretty easy.

This is a complete example of how doing it:

If your HTML is:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
    <h1>Enter some text</h1>
    <h2>(it will be converted to uppercase)</h2>
    <form action="." method="POST">
        <input type="text" name="text">
        <input type="submit" name="my-form" value="Send">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
Then your flask application can be something like this:

from flask import Flask
from flask import request
from flask import render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def my_form():
    return render_template("my-form.html")

@app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
def my_form_post():

    text = request.form['text']
    processed_text = text.upper()
    return processed_text

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
That is:

Create a view that accepts a POST request (my_form_post)
access the form elements in the dictionary request.form
This is the flask documentation about accessing request data.

If you need more complicated forms that need validation then you can take a look at WTForms and how to integrate them with flask.

Note: unless you have any other restrictions, you don't really need JavaScript at all to send your data (although you can use it).
